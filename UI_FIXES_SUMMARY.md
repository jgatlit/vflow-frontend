# UI Layout & Variable System Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. UI Layout Problems âœ…
**Problems:**
- 'Show Flows' button obscured 'Node Palette'
- Duplicate zoom/fit controls (lower left AND lower right)
- Lower right buttons obscured canvas outline
- 'Run Flow' button obscured 'saved at' timestamp

**Solutions Applied:**
- **Show Flows**: Moved toggle button to `bottom-16 left-4` (bottom-left, above React Flow controls)
- **Sidebar**: Repositioned to `bottom-24 left-4` with max height to not overlap Node Palette
- **Duplicate Controls**: Removed `CanvasControls` component entirely - now uses only React Flow's built-in `<Controls />`
- **SaveIndicator**: Moved from `right-4` to `right-32` to avoid overlap with Run Flow button
- **ExecutionPanel**:
  - Run Flow button at `right-4` (top-right)
  - History button at `right-140` (next to Run Flow)
  - Results panel unchanged

### 2. Variable System Enhancements âœ…
**Problems:**
- Variables not visible or highlighted in LLM node inputs
- No clear method for passing variables between connected nodes
- Users couldn't see how to reference node outputs

**Solutions Applied:**

#### Variable Highlighting (VariableTextarea component)
- **Enhanced highlighting**: Changed from Tailwind classes to inline styles for compatibility with Tailwind v4
  - Variables now highlighted with: `background-color: #dbeafe; color: #1e40af; font-weight: 600`
  - More visible and consistent across all browsers
- **Variable chips**: Updated with inline styles and icon (`ðŸ”— Variables:`)
- **Syntax**: `{{variableName}}` pattern detection and highlighting

#### Output Variable Reference System
Added helpful info sections to all LLM nodes (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini):
```tsx
<div className="p-2 bg-blue-50 rounded text-xs">
  <span className="font-semibold">ðŸ’¡ Output:</span> Reference this node's result using{' '}
  <code className="bg-white px-1 py-0.5 rounded font-mono">{{nodeId}}</code>
</div>
```

**How Variable Passing Works:**
1. Each node has a unique ID (e.g., "2", "3", "4")
2. Node outputs are stored in execution context with their ID
3. Reference any node's output using `{{nodeId}}` syntax
4. Example: If node "2" outputs "hello", use `{{2}}` in node "3" to access it
5. VariableTextarea highlights all `{{...}}` patterns and shows variable chips

## Files Modified

### Layout Fixes
- `/src/App.tsx` - Removed CanvasControls import and usage
- `/src/components/FlowListSidebar.tsx` - Repositioned toggle and sidebar
- `/src/components/SaveIndicator.tsx` - Moved position (right-32)
- `/src/components/ExecutionPanel.tsx` - Adjusted button positions

### Variable System
- `/src/components/VariableTextarea.tsx` - Enhanced highlighting with inline styles
- `/src/nodes/OpenAINode.tsx` - Added output reference helper
- `/src/nodes/AnthropicNode.tsx` - Added output reference helper
- `/src/nodes/GeminiNode.tsx` - Added output reference helper

## Testing the Fixes

### UI Layout Test
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Verify:
   - âœ… Show Flows button is at bottom-left, doesn't overlap Node Palette
   - âœ… Only one set of zoom controls (bottom-left, built-in React Flow)
   - âœ… Run Flow button (top-right) doesn't overlap SaveIndicator
   - âœ… All buttons are clearly visible and accessible
   - âœ… Canvas outline not obscured by controls

### Variable System Test
1. Create two connected LLM nodes (e.g., OpenAI â†’ Anthropic)
2. In first node's User Prompt: `return yellow`
3. Note the output reference helper showing `{{2}}` (or whatever the node ID is)
4. In second node's User Prompt: `respond to message: {{2}}`
5. Verify:
   - âœ… `{{2}}` is highlighted in blue background
   - âœ… Variable chip appears below: `ðŸ”— Variables: {{2}}`
   - âœ… Output reference helper shows how to reference this node
6. Run the flow
7. Verify:
   - âœ… First node outputs "yellow"
   - âœ… Second node receives and responds to "yellow"
   - âœ… Execution Results shows both outputs correctly

## Current State

**âœ… All layout issues resolved**
**âœ… Variable system fully functional**
**âœ… All LLM nodes have output reference helpers**
**âœ… VariableTextarea highlighting working with Tailwind v4**

**Application Status:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (Tailwind CSS v4, all fixes applied)
- Backend: http://localhost:3000 (LLM services operational)
- 6 Node Types: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Notes, Python, JavaScript
- Variable substitution working across all node types
- Multi-flow save/load operational
- Execution engine with code execution support

## Next Steps

Users can now:
- Build complex multi-node flows with clear variable references
- See exactly how to pass data between nodes
- Have a clean, unobstructed UI
- Understand variable syntax with visual highlighting
