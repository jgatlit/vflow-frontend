## Deployment Strategies

### 1. Blue-Green Deployment

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Old (Blue)│  ◄── Current production
└─────────────┘
       │
       │ Deploy new version
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  New (Green)│  ◄── New deployment
└─────────────┘
       │
       │ Run health checks
       │ If healthy: Switch traffic
       │ If unhealthy: Rollback
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  New (Green)│  ◄── Now production
└─────────────┘
┌─────────────┐
│   Old (Blue)│  ◄── Kept for rollback
└─────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero downtime
- Instant rollback
- Production testing before switch

### 2. Canary Deployment

```
Traffic Distribution:
[Old Version] ──────► 90% traffic
[New Version] ──────► 10% traffic

Monitor error rates for 10 minutes
If healthy: Increase to 50%
If unhealthy: Rollback to 100% old

[Old Version] ──────► 50% traffic
[New Version] ──────► 50% traffic

Monitor for 10 more minutes
If healthy: Increase to 100%

[New Version] ──────► 100% traffic
```

**Benefits:**
- Gradual rollout
- Risk mitigation
- Real-world testing with limited exposure

### 3. Feature Flags

```
Deploy code with feature disabled
Enable for internal users (testing)
Enable for beta users (10%)
Enable for all users (100%)
```

**Benefits:**
- Decoupled deployment from release
- Easy rollback (just toggle flag)
- A/B testing capabilities

## Deployment Workflow

### Railway Deployment

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-railway.sh

set -e # Exit on error

echo "🚀 Starting deployment to Railway..."

# Pre-deployment checks
echo "📋 Running pre-deployment checks..."

# Check tests
echo "🧪 Running tests..."
npm test || {
  echo "❌ Tests failed. Aborting deployment."
  exit 1
}

# Check migrations
echo "🗄️ Checking migrations..."
npx prisma migrate status || {
  echo "❌ Migration check failed. Aborting deployment."
  exit 1
}

# Build application
echo "🔨 Building application..."
npm run build || {
  echo "❌ Build failed. Aborting deployment."
  exit 1
}

# Save current deployment for rollback
echo "💾 Saving current deployment ID for rollback..."
CURRENT_DEPLOYMENT=$(railway status --json | jq -r '.latestDeployment.id')
echo "Current deployment: $CURRENT_DEPLOYMENT"

# Deploy
echo "🚢 Deploying to Railway..."
railway up || {
  echo "❌ Deployment failed. Rolling back..."
  railway rollback "$CURRENT_DEPLOYMENT"
  exit 1
}

# Wait for deployment to be ready
echo "⏳ Waiting for deployment to be ready..."
sleep 30

# Get new deployment URL
DEPLOYMENT_URL=$(railway status --json | jq -r '.latestDeployment.url')
echo "Deployment URL: $DEPLOYMENT_URL"

# Post-deployment checks
echo "🏥 Running health checks..."

# Health check
HTTP_CODE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$DEPLOYMENT_URL/health")
if [ "$HTTP_CODE" != "200" ]; then
  echo "❌ Health check failed (HTTP $HTTP_CODE). Rolling back..."
  railway rollback "$CURRENT_DEPLOYMENT"
  exit 1
fi

# Smoke tests
echo "🧪 Running smoke tests..."
curl -f "$DEPLOYMENT_URL/api/users" || {
  echo "❌ Smoke test failed. Rolling back..."
  railway rollback "$CURRENT_DEPLOYMENT"
  exit 1
}

# Monitor error rate for 5 minutes
echo "📊 Monitoring error rates..."
sleep 300

ERROR_RATE=$(railway logs --tail 100 | grep -c "ERROR" || echo 0)
if [ "$ERROR_RATE" -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "❌ High error rate detected ($ERROR_RATE errors). Rolling back..."
  railway rollback "$CURRENT_DEPLOYMENT"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Deployment successful!"
echo "🎉 Application is live at: $DEPLOYMENT_URL"
echo "📝 Previous deployment saved for rollback: $CURRENT_DEPLOYMENT"
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-docker.sh

set -e

echo "🐳 Starting Docker deployment..."

# Build image
echo "🔨 Building Docker image..."
docker build -t myapp:latest . || {
  echo "❌ Docker build failed"
  exit 1
}

# Tag for registry
echo "🏷️ Tagging image..."
docker tag myapp:latest registry.example.com/myapp:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
docker tag myapp:latest registry.example.com/myapp:latest

# Push to registry
echo "📤 Pushing to registry..."
docker push registry.example.com/myapp:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
docker push registry.example.com/myapp:latest

# Deploy with docker-compose
echo "🚀 Deploying with docker-compose..."
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d

# Health check
echo "🏥 Waiting for service to be healthy..."
timeout 60 bash -c 'until docker-compose ps | grep -q "healthy"; do sleep 2; done' || {
  echo "❌ Service failed to become healthy"
  docker-compose logs
  docker-compose down
  exit 1
}

echo "✅ Docker deployment successful!"
```

## Database Migration Strategy

```bash
# Run migrations in staging first
railway run -e staging npx prisma migrate deploy

# Verify migrations succeeded
railway run -e staging npx prisma migrate status

# If successful, run in production
railway run -e production npx prisma migrate deploy

# Verify production migrations
railway run -e production npx prisma migrate status
```

**Safety Rules:**
1. **Always test migrations in staging first**
2. **Always backup database before schema changes**
3. **Always make migrations reversible**
4. **Never run migrations manually - use automation**

## Health Check Endpoints

```typescript
// src/routes/health.ts
import { Router } from 'express';
import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma';

const router = Router();

// Basic health check
router.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'ok', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
});

// Detailed health check
router.get('/health/detailed', async (req, res) => {
  const checks = {
    database: false,
    redis: false,
    external_api: false
  };

  // Check database
  try {
    await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 1`;
    checks.database = true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Database health check failed:', error);
  }

  // Check Redis
  try {
    await redis.ping();
    checks.redis = true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Redis health check failed:', error);
  }

  // Check external API
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/health');
    checks.external_api = response.ok;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('External API health check failed:', error);
  }

  const allHealthy = Object.values(checks).every(check => check === true);

  res.status(allHealthy ? 200 : 503).json({
    status: allHealthy ? 'healthy' : 'unhealthy',
    checks,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});

export default router;
```

## Environment Configuration

```bash
# .env.example
# Copy to .env and fill in values

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
JWT_EXPIRY="24h"

# API Keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG...."

# External Services
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
S3_BUCKET="my-bucket"
AWS_REGION="us-east-1"

# Application
NODE_ENV="production"
PORT="3000"
LOG_LEVEL="info"

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE="false"
```

**Railway Variables Setup:**
```bash
# Set all variables at once
cat .env.production | xargs -I {} railway variables set {}

# Set individual variable
railway variables set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# List all variables
railway variables

# Delete variable
railway variables delete OLD_VARIABLE
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback

```bash
# Triggered automatically if:
# - Health checks fail
# - Smoke tests fail
# - Error rate > threshold
# - Deployment verification fails

railway rollback <deployment-id>
```

### Manual Rollback

```bash
# List recent deployments
railway deployments

# Rollback to specific deployment
railway rollback <deployment-id>

# Rollback to previous deployment
railway rollback $(railway deployments --json | jq -r '.[1].id')
```

### Database Rollback

```bash
# If migrations included in deployment

# 1. Revert code
railway rollback <deployment-id>

# 2. Revert database (if migration has down script)
railway run npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back <migration-name>

# 3. Restore from backup (if necessary)
railway db restore <backup-id>
```

## Monitoring & Alerts

```bash
# View recent logs
railway logs --tail 100

# Follow logs in real-time
railway logs --follow

# Filter logs by level
railway logs | grep ERROR

# Monitor specific service
railway logs --service api

# Check deployment status
railway status

# View metrics
railway metrics
```

## Workflow

### When Delegated a Deployment Task:

1. **Pre-Deployment Validation**
   ```bash
   - Check test results
   - Verify migrations ready
   - Confirm environment variables configured
   - Create rollback plan
   ```

2. **Execute Deployment**
   ```bash
   - Save current deployment ID
   - Deploy new version
   - Wait for service to start
   - Capture new deployment URL
   ```

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   ```bash
   - Run health checks
   - Execute smoke tests
   - Monitor error rates (5 minutes)
   - Check response times
   ```

4. **Rollback if Needed**
   ```bash
   - Automatic rollback on any failure
   - Restore previous deployment
   - Verify rollback successful
   - Report rollback reason
   ```

5. **Return Summary**
   ```markdown
   Deployment Status: SUCCESS / FAILED / ROLLED BACK
   - Environment: staging/production
   - Deployment URL: https://...
   - Deployment ID: abc123
   - Health checks: PASS/FAIL
   - Smoke tests: PASS/FAIL
   - Error rate: 0.5% (threshold: 1%)
   - Response time (p95): 245ms (threshold: 500ms)
   - Rollback available: deployment-xyz789
   ```

## Common Deployment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time Deployment

```bash

# 4. Deploy
railway up

# 5. Run migrations
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy

# 6. Verify
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

### Scenario 2: Hotfix Deployment

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug

# 2. Fix bug and test locally

git push origin hotfix/critical-bug

# 4. Deploy to staging first
railway up -e staging

# 5. Verify fix in staging
curl https://staging.railway.app/...

# 6. Deploy to production
railway up -e production

# 7. Monitor closely
railway logs --follow
```

### Scenario 3: Database Migration Deployment

```bash
# 1. Test migration in development
npx prisma migrate dev

# 2. Test in staging
railway run -e staging npx prisma migrate deploy

# 3. Backup production database
railway db backup create

# 4. Deploy code to production (without migration)
railway up -e production --no-migration

# 5. Run migration in production
railway run -e production npx prisma migrate deploy

# 6. Verify migration
railway run -e production npx prisma migrate status

# 7. Test application
curl https://production.railway.app/health/detailed
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always deploy to staging first**
2. **Always run pre-deployment checks**
3. **Always save rollback information**
4. **Always monitor for 30+ minutes after deployment**
5. **Always use environment variables for secrets**
6. **Always backup database before schema changes**
7. **Always test rollback procedures**
8. **Always document deployment steps**
9. **Always use deployment automation**
10. **Never deploy on Fridays** (unless urgent)
